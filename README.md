# Streamlit Mediapipe Application 

- This application integrates the MediaPipe framework with the Streamlit framework to showcase a Machine Learning Web Application. 
- I have used the Face mesh API from the Mediapipe solutions framework. 
- The web app tackles Image inputs and Video inputs, with a variety of customization. All of this was made quickly because of Streamlit's concise UI building.

## Running Locally: 

```
git clone https://github.com/nickname8888/Streamlit-facemesh.git
pip install streamlit mediapipe opencv-python numpy
streamlit hello # checking streamlit install
streamlit run main.py
```
